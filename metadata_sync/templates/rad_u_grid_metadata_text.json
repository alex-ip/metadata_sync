	"LINEAGE_STATEMENT": "This %%Calculated/FILENAME%% grid is an airborne-derived Radiometric Uranium Equivalent grid for the %%Survey/SURVEYNAME%% survey. The survey was acquired under the project No. %%Survey/SURVEYID%% for the geological survey of %%Survey/STATE%%. The grid has a cell size of %%Calculated/CELLSIZE_DEG%% degrees (approximately %%Calculated/CELLSIZE_M%%m). A total of %%Survey/TOTAL_KM%% line-kilometres of data at a line spacing of %%Survey/LINE_SPACING%%m were acquired to produce this grid. To constrain long wavelengths in the grid, an independent data set, the Australia-wide Airborne Geophysical Survey (AWAGS) airborne magnetic data, was used to control the base levels of the survey grid (Milligan et al., 2009). This survey grid is essentially levelled to AWAGS. Details of the specifications of individual airborne surveys can be found in the Fourteenth Edition of the Index of Airborne Geophysical Surveys (Percival, 2014). This Index is also available online at http://www.ga.gov.au/metadata-gateway/metadata/record/gcat_f3ad4f15-96bc-0cf3-e044-00144fdd4fa6/Index+of+airborne+geophysical+surveys%3A+14th+edition. Further up to date information about individual surveys can also be obtained online from the Airborne Surveys Database at http://www.ga.gov.au/oracle/argus/. \n\nThe original grid was converted from ERMapper (.ers) format to netCDF4_classic format using GDAL1.11.1. The main purpose of this conversion is to enable access to the data by relevant open source tools and software. The netCDF grid was created on %%Calculated/CONVERSION_DATETIME%% and has its y-axis indexed Southward-positive. \n\nReferences\nMilligan, P.R., Minty, B.R.S., Richardson, M. & Franklin, R., 2009.

	"METADATA_ABSTRACT": "The radiometric, or gamma-ray spectrometric method, measures the natural variations in the gamma-rays detected near the Earth's surface as the result of the natural radioactive decay of Potassium (K), uranium (U) and thorium (Th). The data collected are processed via standard methods to ensure the response recorded is that due only to the rocks in the ground. The results produce datasets that can be interpreted to reveal the geological structure of the sub-surface. The processed data is checked for quality by GA geophysicists to ensure that the final data released by GA are fit-for-purpose.\nThis radiometric uranium grid has a cell size of %%Calculated/CELLSIZE_DEG%% degrees (approximately %%Calculated/CELLSIZE_M%%m) and shows uranium element concentration of the %%Survey/SURVEYNAME%% survey.  The data used to produce this grid was acquired in %%Calculated/YEAR%% by the %%Survey/STATE%% Government, and consisted of %%Survey/TOTAL_KM%% line-kilometres of data at %%Survey/LINE_SPACING%%m line spacing and %%Survey/AGL%%m terrain clearance.",
